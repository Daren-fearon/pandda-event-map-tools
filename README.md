PanDDA-event-map-tools

This guide walks you through a 3-step process to:

Download PDB files using a group deposition ID
Extract PanDDA event maps from structure factor CIF files
Convert them to MTZ format for crystallographic analysis
Scripts can be found at: /dls/science/groups/i04-1/software/scripts/event_map_extractor/

🧾 Step 1: Download PDB Files
📄 Script: batch_download.sh
✅ Purpose:
Downloads various file types (e.g., .cif.gz, .pdb.gz, .sf.cif.gz) from the RCSB PDB using a list of PDB IDs and decompresses files.

🔍 How to Get PDB IDs from a Group Deposition
Go to https://www.rcsb.org

Search for your Group Deposition ID (e.g., G_1001234)

Select Tabular Report Entry IDs and click Download IDs

Save this file in your working directory e.g. as G_1001234.txt

1ABC,2XYZ,3DEF
Alternatively you can manually populate the text file

▶️ Usage:
/dls/science/groups/i04-1/software/scripts/event_map_extractor/batch_download.sh -f input_PDB_ids.txt -o output_dir -c -s

🔤 Options:
Flag	Description
-f <file>	Input file with comma-separated PDB IDs
-o <dir>	Output directory (default: current directory)
-c	Download .cif.gz files
-s	Download -sf.cif.gz files (structure factors)
🛠️ Example:
/dls/science/groups/i04-1/software/scripts/event_map_extractor/batch_download.sh -f G_1001234.txt -o G_1001234 -c -s

This downloads .cif.gz and -sf.cif.gz files and decompresses them into ./G_1001234.

🧪 Step 2: Extract PanDDA Event Maps
📄 Script: extract_pandda_event
✅ Purpose:
Loads the Phenix environment and runs a Python script to extract PanDDA event maps from *-sf.cif files. These can be from PDB download or manually curated cif files.

▶️ Usage:
/dls/science/groups/i04-1/software/scripts/event_map_extractor/extract_pandda_event [space_group=XXX] <file1-sf.cif> [<file2-sf.cif> ...]

Notes:

[space_group=XXX] is optional and should only be necessary when converting event maps to P1
Wildcard *-sf.cif can be used to extract maps from all files within directory.
🛠️ Example:
/dls/science/groups/i04-1/software/scripts/event_map_extractor/extract_pandda_event G_1001234/*-sf.cif

This will:

Load the phenix module
Run the Python script to split and convert the CIF into MTZ files
🧠 Step 3: Python Script – pandda_event_extractor.py
✅ Purpose:
Handles the core logic:

Splits CIF files into:
_data.cif (reference/original data)
_pandda_event.cif (PanDDA event map)
Converts both to .mtz using phenix.cif_as_mtz
Best part is, you don’t have to do anything here.
🧩 Features:
Automatically detects data blocks (sf, Asf, Bsf)
Supports optional space group override
Uses subprocess to run Phenix commands
Logs progress and errors
📦 Output Summary
After running the full workflow, you will have:

_data.mtz: MTZ file from reference/original data
_pandda_event.mtz: MTZ file from PanDDA event map
These files are ready for downstream visualization.
